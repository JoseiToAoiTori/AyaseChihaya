A Discord Bot for personal use. Any functionality is entirely arbitrary and dependent on my mood. Built on top of the Yuuko and Eris frameworks.

***

##Usage

Requires NodeJS and yarn. npm will also work.

```bash
# Edit your config
$ cp sample.config.js config.js && $EDITOR config.js
# Install dependencies
$ yarn
# Start the bot
$ node index
```

And that's it! Submit a PR if you want to contribute. As a terrible dev, I refuse to have due process for contributing.
